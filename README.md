# Predict author's h-index based on text and graph data

### A few instructions and recommendations :

 - This github repository does not host the base data for this challenge, the data should be loaded independently in the /code folder (see kaggle link)
 - For the code to run correctly, you should set your working directory at root /code when running a python script
 - The python files launching models and generating subsequent predictions are located in folders named Model*...* (e.g. ModelGNN) ; a typical model launching would be done by typing in the console "python ModelGNN/GNN.py" with the /code folder as root directory
 - The model classes are in the models.py at the root directory, they are called specifically by each of the files launching models (see above)
